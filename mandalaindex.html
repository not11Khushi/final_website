          <strong>Hello!</strong><br />
          I'm Khushi Mehta, a communication designer with strong interpersonal
          skills and a compassionate nature. I have a deep love for art and
          believe in bringing creativity to life through my work. I also enjoy
          volunteering with NGOs and cherish the experience of working alongside
          them.

      <h3>Where Passion Meets Play</h3>
      <p class="passion-text">
        I’m passionate about both basketball and badminton. On the badminton
        court, I’ve competed at the district level, facing players who’ve really
        pushed my game to the next level. I’ve played countless matches—some
        victorious, some not—and each one has taught me something new. Sports,
        for me, aren’t just about winning; they’re about resilience, teamwork,
        and embracing the lessons that come with every loss as much as every
        win.
